**A Non-Invasive AI-Powered Anemia Screening and Management App**


Scarlet Save is a non-invasive, AI-powered mobile app that helps detect and manage anemia using only a smartphone camera.

Users can track their condition over time through a dedicated patient dashboard and receive doctor follow-up recommendations based on their results
Our app empowers users—especially in rural and underserved communities—to detect, monitor, and manage anemia using just their nails and eyes.
